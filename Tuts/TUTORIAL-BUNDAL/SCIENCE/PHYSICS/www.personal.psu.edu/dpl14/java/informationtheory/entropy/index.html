<B><FONT size=+1>Shannon's Experiment to Calculate the Entropy of English</FONT></B>
<BR><I> by Adriano M. Garsia</I>
<BR>
Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory, devised an experiment
aimed at determining the entropy of an English letter 
(the amount of information in bits that we obtain on the average 
when we learn one letter of English).  The experiment is carried out
as follows.  The user faces a sequence of dashes, each representing
one of the 26 English letters or a space.  The user is to guess the
successive letters of the sentence using only the knowledge of the
letters previously guessed.  At each step we record the total number
of guesses to reach the correct letter for that position.
Shannon views the sequence of numbers of guesses as an encoding of the
orginal sentence.  He uses the entropy of the resulting random
variable as an estimate for the entropy of an English letter.  

<P>
The following applet allows you to simulate the Shannon experiment.
Start typing on the keyboard your guesses for the first letter of 
the sentence.  When you type the correct letter, the letter will 
appear in that position and the number of guesses will be displayed 
underneath it.  Go on to guess the next letter in the same manner.  
You should press the space bar when you believe that a word has
ended.  Note that at the bottom of the Applet the letters
of the alphabet and <I>space</I> appear in blue. When you
guess a letter incorrectly, the computer helps you keep track
of your guesses by erasing those letters from the alphabet.  

<P> When the sentence is complete or when you tire of guessing
letters and click on <i>Entropy</i>, the computer will output the estimate 
of the entropy that results  from this particular experiment. 

Perhaps we should mention that large scale experiments of this kind yield that
the amount of information we gain when we learn a letter of English, within 
a sentence, is aproximately 1.1 bits.  We should also mention
that in a classroom of about 60 students, with everybody venturing
guesses for each next letter, we consistently obtained a value of
about 1.6 bits for the estimate of the entropy.
