Slide Rule
</h2>
<h3>
  Around the middle of the 20th centuty, the slide rule was indispensable for every scientist and engineer.
  <br>
  Today, to know the principle of a slide rule might be still usuful for young people to understand the nature of logarithm.

A slide rule consists of the rule, the slide, and the cursor.<br>
<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial0.JPG"> <br>
You can move the whole system to the right or to the left by dragging the rule.<br>
The slide can be moved along the rule by dragging it.<br>
The cursor with a vertical line can also moved across the slide and rule by dragging it.<br>
 <hr>
The rule has two scales marked D and L.	<br>
The slide carries the scales marked C and CI.<br>
<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial1.JPG"> <br>
In the scale L, numbers show the distance from the origin where the length of rule is assumed to be 1(one).<br> 
The scales D and C are related to the fanction y = log x, where the base of it is 10.<br>
In scales D and C, the numbers are placed at points whose distance from the origin is ther logarithm.<br>
The scale L gives the mantissa of the logarithm of the number standing above it in the scale C.  
For example, log 3.0 = 0.48 by this slide rule.<br> 
The scale CI has the same graduation as the scale C, but it is in the reverse order from right to left.  
A numbers in the scale C gives the inverse of the number located below it in the scale C. 
For example, the inverse of 3.0 is 0.33 by this slide rule.
As in this example, a slide rule requires a rough calculation to determine the number of digits before the dismal point.
<hr>   

 Example 1:<br>
 Multiplication is basen on the law<br>
 log(axb) = log a + log b<br> 
<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial2.JPG"> <br>
The addition of log 2 and log 3 is carried out on the slide rule as addition of two segments of length log 2 and log 3.<br>
The inititial point 1 of the scale C is placed at the point 2 of the scale D.<br>
Then the cursor is placed at the point 3 of the scale C. The product 6 is read out on the scale D.<hr>
Example 2:<br>
 Dvision is basen on the law<br>
 log(a/b) = log a - log b<br> 
 
<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial3.JPG"><br>
The subtraction of log 3 from log 6  is carried out on the slide rule as
 subtraction of the segment length of log 3 from that of log 6.<br>
The inititial point 1 of the scale CI is placed at the point 6 of the scale D.<br>
Then the cursor is placed at the point 3 of the scale CI. The quotient 2 is read out on the scale D.<hr>

Example 3: A more practical procedure of Multiplication is as follows:<br>
One of the factores on the scale CI is placed at the other factor on the
 scale D, and the product is read out at 1 or 10 of the scale C.<br>

<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial4.JPG"><br>
By this method, you might be able to continue the further calculation 
using this result as example 1 or 2 without moving the slide, but only 
moving the cursor.<hr>

Example 4: A more practical procedure of Division is as follows:<br>
The divisor scale C is placed at the divident on the scale D, and the quotient is read out at 1 or 10 of the scale C.<br>

<img src="slide_rule_files/Tutorial5.JPG"><br>
By this method, you might be able to continue the further calculation 
using this result as example 1 or 2 without moving the slide, but only 
moving the cursor.<hr>
