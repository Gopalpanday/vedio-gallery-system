<h1>The Law of Radioactive Decay</h1>

<p>The <em class="Begriff">law of radioactive decay</em> predicts how the number of the not decayed nuclei of a given <em class="Begriff">radioactive substance</em> decreases in the course of time. The red circles of this simulation symbolize 1000&nbsp;atomic nuclei of a radioactive substance whose half-life period (T) amounts to <span class="nobr">20&nbsp;seconds.</span> The diagram in the lower part of the applet represents the fraction of the not yet decayed nuclei <span class="nobr">(N/N<sub>0</sub>)</span> at a given time t, predicted by the following law:</p>

<table class="Formel" align="center"><tr><td class="Formel">
N &nbsp; = &nbsp; N<sub>0</sub> &middot; &nbsp; 2<sup>&#8722;t/T</sup>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="Formel">
N .... number of the not decayed nuclei<br>
N<sub>0</sub> ... number of the initially existing nuclei<br>
t .... time<br>
T .... half-life period
</p>

<p>As soon as the applet is started with the yellow button, the atomic nuclei will begin to &quot;decay&quot; (change of color from red to black). You can stop and continue the simulation by using the button &quot;Pause&nbsp;/&nbsp;Resume&quot;. In this case a blue point for the time and the fraction of the not yet decayed nuclei is drawn into the diagram. (Note that often these points don't lie exactly on the curve!) If you want to restore the initial state, you will have to click on the &quot;Reset&quot; button.</p>

<p>It is possible to give the probability that a single atomic nucleus will &quot;survive&quot; during a given interval. This probability 
amounts to <span class="nobr">50&nbsp;%</span> for one half-life period. In an interval twice as long <span class="nobr">(2&nbsp;T)</span> 
the nucleus survives only with a <span class="nobr">25&nbsp;%</span> probability (half of <span class="nobr">50&nbsp;%),</span> in an interval 
of three half-life periods <span class="nobr">(3&nbsp;T)</span> only with <span class="nobr">12,5&nbsp;%</span> (half of 
<span class="nobr">25&nbsp;%)</span> and so on.</p>

<p>You can't, however, predict the time at which a given atomic nucleus will decay. For example, even if the probability of a decay within the next second is <span class="nobr">99&nbsp;%,</span> it is nevertheless possible (but improbable) that the nucleus decays after millions of years.</p>
