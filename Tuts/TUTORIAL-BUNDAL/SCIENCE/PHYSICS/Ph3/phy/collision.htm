<h1>Elastic and Inelastic Collision</h1>

<p>This Java applet deals with the extreme cases of a collision process illustrated by two wagons: For an <em class="Begriff">elastic collision</em> it is characteristic that the sum of the kinetic energies of the involved bodies is constant. After a perfectly <em class="Begriff">inelastic collision</em>, however, both bodies have the same velocity; the sum of their kinetic energies is reduced, compared with the initial value, because a part of it has changed into internal energy (warming up).</p>

<p>The total momentum of the involved bodies is conserved, regardless whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. The movement of the common center of gravity (indicated by a yellow dot) is not influenced by the collision process.</p>

<p>You can choose the simulation of an elastic or an inelastic collision by using  the appropriate radio button on the top right. The &quot;Reset&quot; button brings the wagons to their initial positions; the animation is started by a mouse click on the &quot;Start&quot; button. If you select the option &quot;Slow motion&quot;, the movement will be ten times slower.</p>

<p>You can write the values of mass and initial velocity into the textfields. Positive (negative) values of velocity mean a motion to the right (left) side. Extreme inputs are automatically changed.</p>

<p>Dependent on the selected radio button (on the bottom right), the applet will illustrate the velocities, the momenta or the kinetic energies of the wagons.</p>
