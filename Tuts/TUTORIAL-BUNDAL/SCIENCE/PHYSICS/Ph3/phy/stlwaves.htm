<h1>Standing Longitudinal Waves</h1>

<p>This Java applet demonstrates the harmonics of the air in a tube as an example of <em class="Begriff">standing longitudinal waves</em>. It illustrates the movement of the molecules in the air during such an oscillation. (Obviously the particles in reality move much shorter distances, and the real movement is very quick.) The <em class="Begriff">nodes</em>, i.e. the places where the particles don't move, are marked with &quot;N&quot;. &quot;A&quot; means an <em class="Begriff">antinode</em>, i.e. a place where the particles oscillate with maximal amplitude. Note that at an open end of the tube there is always an antinode, at a closed end, however, a node!</p>

<p>You can select the form of the tube by using the appropriate radio buttons (&quot;both sides open&quot;, &quot;one side open&quot; and &quot;both dides closed&quot;). It is possible to switch to the next harmonic by pressing the button &quot;Lower&quot; respectively &quot;Higher&quot;. The applet shows the <em class="Begriff">harmonics</em> up to the fifth upper oscillation.</p>

<p>If you write a new value for the length of the tube into the textfield and press the &quot;Enter&quot; key, the applet will calculate wavelength and frequency. The speed of sound was presupposed as <span class="nobr">343.5&nbsp;m/s,</span> corresponding to a temperature of <span class="nobr">20&nbsp;&deg;C.</span> The influence of the tube's diameter is neglected.</p>
