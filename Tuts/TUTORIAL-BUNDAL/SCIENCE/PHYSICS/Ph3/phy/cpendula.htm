<h1>Coupled Pendula</h1>

<p>This simulation shows two <em class="Begriff">pendula coupled by a spring</em> which has a small spring constant (weak coupling). For such systems it is characteristic that the oscillation's energy permanently moves from one partial system to the other.</p>

<p>The &quot;Reset&quot; button brings the system to its initial position. You can start or stop and continue the simulation with the other button. If you choose the option &quot;Slow&nbsp;motion&quot;, the movement will be five times slower.
It is possible to change the initial positions of the two pendula
by using the corresponding text fields. A positive (negative) angle means an elongation to the right (left) side.</p>

<p>You can get the <em class="Begriff">harmonics</em> of the system as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you write two equal numbers into the text fields (e.g. twice <span class="nobr">10&deg;),</span> the two pendula will always have same phases.</li>
<li>By choosing two opposite numbers (e.g. <span class="nobr">8&deg;</span> and <span class="nobr">&#8722;8&deg;),</span> you can get an oscillation with opposite phases.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you write <span class="nobr">0&deg;</span> into one of the text fields for the initial positions, the entire energy of the oscillation will alternately be transferred to one of the pendula: That pendulum which first was in the mid-position oscillates with an ever-increasing amplitude, whereas the amplitude of the other pendulum decreases. After some time there is a moment in which only the first-mentioned pendulum oscillates; the other one stops in the mid-position at that time. Afterwards this process happens again with reversed roles and so on.</p>
