<p><b>A spaceship is flying a distance of 5 light hours, for example from Earth to the planet Pluto. The speed can be regulated with the upper buttons.<br>
The applet demonstrates that the clock in the spaceship goes more slowly than the two clocks of the system in which Earth and Pluto are motionless.</b></p>

<p><b>Formula:</b></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../gifs/zeitdil1.gif" alt="Formula 2" border="1"></p>

<p><pre>
t' ... time indicated by the spaceship clock
t&nbsp; ... time indicated by the clocks of the Earth-Pluto-system
v&nbsp; ... speed of the spacecraft relatively to the system of Earth and Pluto
c&nbsp; ... speed of light
</pre></p>

<p><b>Remarks:
<ol>
<li>In a simplifying way there was assumed an inertial system in which Earth and Pluto are motionless; especially the motion of the two planets around the sun was neglected.
<li>According to an important result of the theory of relativity
on observer in the Earth-Pluto-system would see the spacecraft shortened in the direction of motion. This so-called Lorentz contraction was not taken into consideration in order to make it possible to read off the spaceship's clock.
