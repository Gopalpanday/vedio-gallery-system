<p><b>This Java applet deals with the extreme cases of a collision process illustrated by two wagons: For an <em>elastic collision</em> it is characteristic that the sum of the kinetic energies of the involved bodies is constant. After a <em>perfectly inelastic collision</em>, however, both bodies have the same velocity; the sum of their kinetic energies is reduced, compared with the initial value, because a part of it has changed into internal energy (warming up).</b></p>

<p><b>The total momentum of the involved bodies is conserved,
regardless whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.
The movement of the common center of gravity (indicated by a yellow dot) is not influenced by the collision process.</b></p>

<p><b>You can choose the simulation of an elastic or an inelastic collision by using  the appropriate radio button on the top right.
The &quot;Reset&quot; button brings the wagons to their initial positions; the animation is started by a mouse click on the &quot;Start&quot; button. If you select the option &quot;Slow motion&quot;, the movement will be ten times slower.</b></p>

<p><b>You can write the values of mass and initial velocity
into the textfields. Positive (negative) values of velocity mean a motion to the right (left) side. Extreme inputs are automatically changed.</b></p>

<p><b>Dependent on the selected radio button (on the bottom right),
the applet will illustrate the velocities, the momenta or
the kinetic energies of the wagons.</b></p>
